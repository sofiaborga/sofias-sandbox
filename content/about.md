## My story
---
My curiosity is, and has always been, my North Star in life. A passion for math and problem solving brought me to study physics and I earned my B.Sc. from Lund University. During my studies I made a wondeful discovery - programming. The programming teacher at my high school had, to put it bluntly, an weird attitude towards girls interested in the maths and sciences, and I had happily dismissed the whole topic without thinking. Until I no longer could avoid it, that is. When I learned that my second semester at university would be hard for those who had never programmed before, I freaked out a little to be honest. In order to try to cover up for my ignorance I signed up for a self-study course online, and little did I know that this would completely change my outlook and interests. It also began to dawn on me that ...

proved to be a dead end and a time-out was due.

So I turned to my other passion, rock climbing. It is a wonderful hobby (or sport? way of life? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) for many reasons, some of my favourite ones being:
- There is no room to be anywhere other than in the moment
- Relationship with climbing partners
- Relationship with nature, the rock offers the same obstacle for anyone
  and one has to respond

In other words, worthwile for anyone curious about problem solving, collaboration and the human mind - a brilliant vehicle for exploring the outer and inner world.


It was also because of climbing friends I came to Munich in 2019, where I met my partner and subsequently decided to make my new base camp.

I am currently working on open source and volunteer projects, and exploring what turning myself into a data scientist entails. I'm considering both going back to uni for a M Sc, and starting to dig into software engineering as a junior developer. Thus I'm open for opportunities (Munich area or remote) and glady accept any suggestions for options to look into.
